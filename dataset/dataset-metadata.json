  "description": "This dataset contains detailed vulnerability information extracted from the CISA vulnrichment repository, including CVE details, CVSS v3.1 metrics, SSVC decision scores, and affected products. The data is automatically updated daily to provide the most current vulnerability intelligence.\n\n## Dataset Contents\n\n- **CVE Identifiers**: Unique vulnerability identifiers\n- **CVSS v3.1 Metrics**: Complete scoring including base score, attack vector, complexity, etc.\n- **SSVC Scores**: Stakeholder-Specific Vulnerability Categorization decisions\n- **Impact Analysis**: Technical impact assessments and exploitability information\n- **Product Information**: Affected vendors, products, and vulnerable versions\n- **CWE Classifications**: Common Weakness Enumeration mappings\n- **KEV Status**: CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities inclusion\n\n## Data Schema\n\nThe CSV contains the following columns:\n- `cve_id`: CVE identifier (e.g., CVE-2023-12345)\n- `published_date`: Initial publication date\n- `updated_date`: Last modification date\n- `base_score`: CVSS v3.1 base score (0-10)\n- `base_severity`: Severity rating (NONE, LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, CRITICAL)\n- `attack_vector`: Attack vector (NETWORK, ADJACENT_NETWORK, LOCAL, PHYSICAL)\n- `attack_complexity`: Attack complexity (LOW, HIGH)\n- `privileges_required`: Required privileges (NONE, LOW, HIGH)\n- `user_interaction`: User interaction requirement (NONE, REQUIRED)\n- `scope`: Scope (UNCHANGED, CHANGED)\n- `confidentiality_impact`: CIA impact (NONE, LOW, HIGH)\n- `integrity_impact`: CIA impact (NONE, LOW, HIGH)\n- `availability_impact`: CIA impact (NONE, LOW, HIGH)\n- `ssvc_exploitation`: SSVC exploitation status\n- `ssvc_automatable`: SSVC automatability assessment\n- `ssvc_technical_impact`: SSVC technical impact\n- `ssvc_decision`: SSVC final decision (Track, Attend, Act)\n- `cisa_kev`: Known Exploited Vulnerability status (TRUE/FALSE)\n- `cisa_kev_date`: Date added to KEV catalog\n- `impacted_vendor`: Primary affected vendor\n- `impacted_products`: List of affected products\n- `vulnerable_versions`: List of vulnerable versions\n- `cwe_number`: Common Weakness Enumeration ID\n- `cwe_description`: CWE description\n\n## Update Frequency\n\nThis dataset is automatically updated daily using GitHub Actions, ensuring you always have access to the latest vulnerability data from CISA's vulnrichment repository.\n\n## Data Source\n\nData is extracted from the official CISA vulnrichment repository: https://github.com/cisagov/vulnrichment\n\n## Use Cases\n\n- Vulnerability research and analysis\n- Risk assessment and prioritization\n- Security dashboard development\n- Threat intelligence integration\n- Academic research in cybersecurity\n- Compliance and audit activities\n\n## License\n\nThis dataset is provided under the Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal license, allowing for unrestricted use.",
